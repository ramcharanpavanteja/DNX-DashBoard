        <h1>Suresh Raina
        </h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p>>In 2000, Raina decided to play cricket and subsequently
                moved from his hometown Muradnagar, Ghaziabad district to Lucknow, to
                attend the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College, Lucknow.[16] He rose to
                become the captain of the Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence
                amongst Indian selectors in 2002 when he was selected at the age of
                15+1⁄2 years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of
                half-centuries in the U-19 Test matches.[18] He toured Sri Lanka later that
                year with the U-17 team. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh
                against Assam in February 2003 at the age of 16 but did not play another
                match until the following season. He debuted in List A Cricket against
                Madhya Pradesh at Indore in 2005 and scored 16 runs. Suresh Raina's
                father Trilokchand Raina was a military officer in an ordinance factory. His
                family left 'Rainawari' in Jammu and Kashmir union territory of India amid
                the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in the 1990s and settled down in
                Muradnagar town, Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh. Raina trained in the
                Guru Gobind Singh sports college, Lucknow in 1998. Raina has a sister and
                his one elder brother is in the Indian Army.[57] Raina married Priyanka on 3
                April 2015.[58] They have two children.[58] Raina's uncle Ashok Kumar was
                assaulted during a robbery in their house in Punjab, and didn't survive. Due
                to this, Raina withdrew from 2020 IPL season to be with his family</p>
